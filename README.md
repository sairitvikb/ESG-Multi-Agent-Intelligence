# 🌍 ESG Orchestrator  
### Multi-Agent LLM System for ESG Report Automation

An intelligent multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction, structuring, and generation of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reports from unstructured corporate documents.

This project demonstrates how agentic AI architectures can improve reasoning reliability, modularity, and output quality compared to traditional single-agent pipeline.

## 🚀 Overview

Corporate ESG disclosures are often published as lengthy PDF reports that are:

- Unstructured
- Inconsistent in formatting
- Time-consuming to analyze manually

This system automates ESG analysis using:

- PDF content extraction
- Structured data transformation
- Multi-agent LLM orchestration
- Evaluation and validation modules

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The platform supports two execution modes:

### 🔹 Single-Agent Pipeline
A baseline implementation where one LLM handles:
- Extraction  
- Reasoning  
- Summary generation  

Used for performance comparison.

---

### 🔹 Multi-Agent Pipeline
A modular agent-based architecture including:

- 📄 **Extraction Agent** – Identifies ESG-relevant sections  
- 🧩 **Structuring Agent** – Categorizes content into Environmental, Social, Governance  
- 📝 **Generation Agent** – Produces structured ESG summaries  
- 🔍 **Evaluation Agent** – Validates completeness and coherence  

This separation of responsibilities improves interpretability and scalability.
